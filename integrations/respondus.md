Q. I am trying to take a Respondus Test and it is asking me for a password?
A. Please check which browser you are using. If the test requires Respondus LockDown Browser, you must use that browser to access Blackboard to take your test. The Respondus LockDown Browser will enter the password for you.

Q. Can an iPad be used with LockDown Browser?
A. The iPad Edition of "LockDown Browser" (available from iTunes) enables a student to use an iPad to take exams that require LockDown Browser. However, the instructor must select the appropriate setting for each exam to permit students to use an iPad.
